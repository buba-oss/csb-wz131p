      <p1> My headmaster insisted that I found a job in the tourism industry and I 
        was lucky enough to began work immediately as a driver and tour guide.

        <p5><strong>Kerbatch</strong> or Kerr Batch is an area located in the Central River 
          Division in The Gambia. It is famous for its ancient stone circles which considered 
          to be an important part of The Senegambian stone circles which are divided into four
           large sites: Sine Ngayene and Wanar in Senegal, and Wassu and Kerbatch in the Central
           # River Region in Gambia. The date of construction of these monuments is not yet certain, 
           but the generally accepted range is between the 3rd century BC and the 16th century AD. 
           The Kerbatch stone circles consists of 9 stone circles and one double circle and they 
           were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006, as part of Stone Circles of 
           Senegambia.

      <p6><strong>Brief synthesis</strong>
        The inscribed site corresponds to four large groups of megalithic circles located in
         the extreme western part of West Africa, between the River Gambia and the River 
         Senegal. These sites, Wassu, and Kerbatch in Gambia, and Wanar and Sine Ngayene 
         in Senegal, represent an extraordinary concentration of more than 1,000 stone 
         circles and related tumuli spread over a territory of 100 km wide and 350 km in 
         length, along the River Gambia. Together, the four groups comprise 93 circles and 
         associated sites, some of which have been excavated, some of which have revealed 
         archaeological material and human burials, from pottery to iron instruments and 
         ornamentation dating between the 1 st and 2nd millennia to our era. These four 
         megalithic sites are the most dense concentration in the zone and have Outstanding 
         Universal Value, representing a traditional monumental megalithic construction 
         spread out over a vast area, with more than 1,000 stone circles scattered along 
         one of the major rivers of Africa.
        The Sine Ngayene complex (Senegal) is the largest site in the area. It consists of
         <b>52 circles </b>of standing stones, including one double circle. In all, there are 
         <b>1102 </b>carved stones on the site. Around 1km to the east, (outside the inscribed
          property) is the quarry from which the monoliths were extracted and where the sources 
          of around 150 stones can be traced. The site was excavated around 1970, and more recently
           by Bocoum and Holl. The work established that the single burials appeared to precede in 
           time the multiple burials associated with the stone circles. The Wanar complex (Senegal)
            consists of 21 circles including one double circle. The site contains 9 ‘lyre’ stones 
            or bifed stones, sometimes with a cross piece strung between the two halves. The Wassu 
            complex (Guinea) consists of 11 circles and their associated frontal stones. This site
             has the highest stones of the area. The most recent excavations conducted on these 
             megalithic circles date to the Anglo-Gambian campaign led by Evans and Ozanne in 
             1964 and 1965. The finds of burials enabled the dating of the monuments between 927 
             and 1305 AD. The Kerbatch complex consists of 9 circles, including a double circle.
              The site possesses a ‘bifid’ stone, the only known one in the area.
        The stones forming the circles were extracted from nearby laterite quarries
         using iron tools and skilfully shaped into almost identical pillars, either
          cylindrical or polygonal, on average around 2 m in height and weighing up to 
          7 tons. Each circle contains between eight to fourteen standing stones having a
           diameter of four to six metres. The four megalithic sites inscribed bear witness 
           to a prosperous and highly organized society with traditions of stone circle
            constructions, associated with burials, and persisting in certain areas over 
            more than a millennium.

      <p> <strong>Criterion (i)</strong>: Individual stones finely carved bear witness 
        to an exact and experienced technique and contribute to the organized and imposing 
        size of the stone circle groups.
       <strong>Criterion (iii):</strong> The circles of stones proposed for inscription
        represent the totality of the megalithic area in which the presence of such a large
         number of circles is a unique manifestation of construction and funerary practices 
         which persisted for over a millennium across a large geographical area and reflecting
          a sophisticated and productive society.
      </p>
  
      <strong>Integrity</strong>
      The integrity of the four components of the site can only be evaluated as part of a 
      much wider unified cultural complex. The complexes conserve their integrity in terms 
      of spatial associations of the component circles, individual megaliths and tumuli.
       The spiritual beliefs associated to the stones by local communities help to protect 
       their integrity.
    
        <p><strong>Authenticity
      </strong>
      The stone circles stand in a farmed landscape and there have been few interventions.
       A very small number of stones have been removed. Some burial sites have been excavated 
       and subsequently back-filled. These disturbances remain minimal. The overall 
       authenticity of the four sites is intact.

      <strong>
        <p>Protection and management requirements
      </strong>
      In Gambia, management of the of the two sites <b>(Wassu and Kerbath)</b> 
      fall under the responsibility of the National Centre for Arts and Culture 
      (NCAC) in accordance with the law promulgated by the National Assembly 
      <b>(NCAC Law of 1989, amended in 2003).</b> The NCAC is the dismantled technical 
      section of the Ministry of Tourism and Culture. The daily management of the sites 
      is under the responsibility of the Directorate for Cultural Heritage of the NCAC that
       employs, on a permanent basis, the caretakers and maintenance staff. Both sites have
        a management plan prepared during the nomination process with participatory cooperation 
        of local communities and their representatives. The two sites are fenced and four 
        thatched round buildings, built in the manner of traditional houses, serve as a 
        museum, visitor reception facilities and lodgings for the caretaker. The NCAC has
         support from local management committees that ensure the interests of the community 
         in the sites. Funding is principally provided by Government revenue from visitor 
         entrance fees and other subventions.
        </p>
  
      <strong>
        <p>In Senegal,
      </strong> the two sites enjoy legal protection: <b>Law No.71-12 of 25 January 1971,
      </b> regulating the regime for historical sites and monuments and excavations and finds/
      <b> Decree 73-746 of 8 August 1973 </b> promulgating the law. The Directorate of Cultural 
      Heritage of the Ministry is responsible for the management of the sites. The communities
       also have extended powers through the Law on decentralization facilitating their 
       involvement in the management of the sites. The funding sources are: the State budget, 
       local communities and donor subventions. These funds have enabled the fencing of the two 
       sites, the construction of a hall (Wanar) and a welcome space (Sine Ngayene), visitor 
       sanitary facilities as well as the funding of two full-time caretakers. Good signposting 
       was installed to access the two sites as well as an interpretation centre at Sine Ngayene.
        In the long-term, improvement to the access paths is foreseen in the presentation 
        framework. 
      </p>
  
      <p>The management plan was prepared in consultation with the Senegalese and Gambian
         stakeholders meeting in Wassu in Gambia and Ngayene in Senegal in December 2004.
        The long-term objective of this action plan is to render the site visible,
         accessible and ensure economic benefits for the local communities. Beyond 
         the conservation and enhancement of the sites, the management envisages 
         conducting in-depth research and enable the sites to be better adapted to
          the development objectives at the national level.
